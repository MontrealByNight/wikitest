# Coterie

## What is a Coterie

* A small group of people with shared interests or tastes, especially one that is exclusive of other people. _"a coterie of friends and advisers"_ \[Google definition]
* Coterie is a term used in Vampire: The Masquerade to denote a group of vampires who have banded together for a common purpose. Typically, they choose to band together on their own, under the belief that safety lies in numbers. On occasion, the prince has been known to assign neonates together as a "coterie" for a specific task. \[VTM Wiki]

A coterie is a group of kindred, between 3 and 6, that work together towards a common goal.&#x20;

May that goal obtain Princedom, become Warlords, have the Strongest family, amass resources or knowledge... That is decided by it's members.&#x20;

In this game, while "temporary coteries" might form due to plots, quests, interaction... what we are about to give rules for is the permanent coteries. The one that stick together for a long time.

A coterie must be formed in game. No coterie can be created without interaction between their future members.&#x20;

They must share a common goal and have discussed it, in game, at least a few times. This prerequisite is really important.&#x20;

It does happen really often that players want their characters to interact and create a Coterie, but more often than not the characters share a different in game agenda and so the coteries fizzle at it's creation.&#x20;

After all, all kindred are selfish creature of the nights that rarely tolerates other possible causes of problems.

To create a Coterie then, once the kindred have agreed in game to the possible terms of this agreement, one of the player will open a coterie ticket in the ticket channel and will state who are the other members, what are the goals of said coterie, what's their name \[which will be more or less known in game, depending on the choices made] and what archetype they intend to fulfil.&#x20;

The archetypes are just a guideline, it does not mean that you will need the merits or the backgrounds listed in the books, is more to give the storyteller an idea of what the coterie wants to do in the medium to long term.

## Merits and Advantages

Each coterie member can "pool" together their backgrounds with the coterie, so the other members can use them as if they had them.&#x20;

> For example, let's pretend that Caine has 3 dots in contact, while Abel has 1 dot in influence. They can pool them together so, for example, Caine can use the dot in influence from Abel even if Abel is not currently present.&#x20;
>
> And vice versa, Abel can use the 3 dots contact of his coterie mate. This still consume the dots as normal, so be carefull and plan those expenditures with your coterie mates.

Some backgrounds can be pooled, but they almost never do not stack directly.&#x20;

Having two different players with 2 dots each in `Influence [Criminal world]` does not mean that they can pool it together to have 4 dots of `Influence [Criminal world]`.&#x20;

Even if those background can be accessed by the whole coterie, they do stack and create higher levels.&#x20;

The exception is for the haven. Two players having a 1 dot haven might forfeit that to get a bigger, shared haven that's worth 2 dots.

It's hard to confine the rules for all the backgrounds and all the situations, remember to always discuss with the STs when something wants to be pooled. Resource never stack. It can be pooled, but they will be separate entries.

Each coterie, independently from the number of partecipants, will begin with:

* 1 dot in Domain, Portillon, Chasse and Lien
* 4 points of advantages that can be spent towards the Coterie, in either backgrounds, merits or clan coterie merits

Any member of the coterie might spend experience to buy more dots.&#x20;

The experience must be spent by one person for each independent merit, but any person can chip in.&#x20;

> For example, Caine's player wants to buy 2 dots in haven, which would cost 6 experience.&#x20;
>
> He, Abel and Lilith can share the cost for a full dot, but not split the dot between themselves.&#x20;
>
> Which means that Caine can spend 3 experience and Abel can spend 3 experience, so they both buy a full dot.&#x20;
>
> What they **cannot** do is, spend 2 exp each and split the cost of a single dot.&#x20;
>
> Some merits that are worth multiple dots are required to be bought in full by one single player.

## What do the Backgrounds do?

### Domain

The domain rating is the size of your coterie's domain. A one dot might be a big building or a couple of smaller ones, a 5 dots is a big area, like the whole of Little Italy or the Gay Village.&#x20;

The domain rating is given by the average of the other 3 traits \[Portillon, Chasse and Lien], rounded down.&#x20;

This trait does not exist in the corebook and it's just a way to gauge the approximate size of the Domain held by the coterie.

This domain might or might not be public knowledge.&#x20;

A coterie needs to be sure that they are able to defend their domain, in case other kindreds aim at it.

A Camarilla coterie can have their domain in contested or even Anarch territory, but if this knowledge becomes public, other people might try to take it away from them and reclaim it for their sect or their own coterie.&#x20;

Even inside the same sect, a coterie might lose a status battle against another coterie, or the coterie can act against the sect and they might get shunned and so on...&#x20;

Some coterie prefer to keep themselvs on the down side ("Hey, we have a block Downtown, no one know we have a Haven there, dont bring anyone in") or might decide to go public ("The Coterie of Carna has opened the doors to their Domain, inviting all redworkers to come and share knowledge").&#x20;

That is a personal choice that depends on each single coterie.&#x20;

It goes unsaid that, if a coterie's domain is unknown, they rarely will have a strong hold over it&#x20;

> "What do you mean i poached in your domain? This is no one's land."

A domain MUST be anchored to an existing named location (the ones in the pins of each channel). In extraordinary cases, if the staff sees it fit, a new location can be created and named for a coterie, on a case by case basis. Do not expect this to be the norm.

The number of locations a Coterie can hold depends on their domain rating.

* Domain 1-3: 1 location&#x20;
* Domain 4: 2 locations&#x20;
* Domain 5: 3 locations

In case of multiple locations, it's adviced that they are in one single channel, but they can be split across multiple far away location. It does mean, of course, that it's harder to do as such.

### Portillon

Portillon is the general security of said domain.&#x20;

This is represented in a ton of different way. It could be access to CCTV in front of the main building, it could be in the form of some passerby, it could be some animal ghouls patrolling the block, it could be many and many other ways, depending on the location and the coterie's tools.

Any actions taken knowingly inside another Domain incur in a penalty in dice equal to Portillon.&#x20;

On a failure, even if the roll has been taken with the Portillon penalty, the Coterie holding the Domain will get to know that someone did something in their domain (details and celerity of said intel might be more or less accurate depending on the situation).&#x20;

Alternately, if there are no reasons to believe a place is owned by another Coterie or if simply one does not care about the consequences, actions and rolls might be done ignoring the Portillon penalty.&#x20;

And also in this case, the Coterie that owns the domain _will_ know that something has happened.

### Chasse

Chasse is how dense of human is the Domain and how easy is to hunt in those places.&#x20;

All the Hunts (except Blood leech), for any kindred (even poachers) inside the Domain have a difficulty reduction by 1 for each point in Chasse (always minimum of DC 2).&#x20;

The different Predator Types, tho, need to make sense with the Domain to be able to hunt there.&#x20;

For example, a Coterie that holds a Club and the offices nearby inside the Gay Village will have a real hard time to hunt Graverobber, and so that is not a Predator Type that we'd allow to hunt with in that case.

### Lien

Lien is how incorporated is the Coterie with the local Community.&#x20;

How easy is to obtain information, have successfull investigations and so on. It also increases the ability of the coterie to deal with the population living inside their Domain and that might bring ulterior advantages.&#x20;

For example, a coterie that has a police department within their Domain, might have an easier time trying to get a Contact or an Influence within the Police.&#x20;

A Coterie talking with the inhabitants of the domain might have an easier time tracking down that breach that some poachers caused. Each dot of Lien gives a bonus to all the dice pools used to interact with the people inside the Domain.

### Coterie Without Domain optional rule

Some Coteries might not have a domain (maybe they are inter sects, maybe they want to remain hidden, maybe they are not stationary.) In that case, they could swap the automatic dots in Chasse, Lien and Portillon for related Backgrounds instead.

* Chasse becomes Haven, Haven merits, Herd or Retainers.
* Lien becomes Contacts, Influence or Retainers.
* Portillon becomes Allies, Mask, Mawla or Retainers.

### Coterie Creation and Coterie Sheet

A Coterie sheet will look something like this:<br>

> Type: Commando&#x20;
>
> Name: Example Coterie&#x20;
>
> Symbol: 🏰

> Domain Traits:&#x20;

>
> Members:&#x20;
>
> Cain&#x20;
>
> Montano&#x20;
>
> Ur Shulgi&#x20;
>
> Abel

In this example, the domain rating is 1 (there are 5 dots total in the three traits, and the average rounded down is 1).&#x20;

The one marked (free dots) are the 4 free dots that any coterie has.&#x20;

The one without the exp expenditures are the backgrounds and the merit that one member adds to the coterie and they already have from before (Cain has a very good haven that they want to use for the coterie haven, so all his points transfers here).&#x20;

The contacts and the influence are pooled among the members, means they don't pay anything as they already have them, but the coterie can have access to them independently.

The ones that say (name, exp cost) are the ones that need to be paid when the coterie is formed. In case a member leaves the coterie or the coterie is dissolved, those experience points are to be refunded to the character that spent experience for those. Same thing if those merits are lost for one reason or another.

Also, each coterie has access to a channel for their coterie haven / location. This is something that needs to be covered during the creation of the coterie and in the ticket, as the players will need to provide name for the location and pictures for the channel.

### Portillon, Lien and Chasse merits

The three traits have some specific merits that are accessible to the coterie. Those merits usually mean the coterie has access to some specific buildings or has some particular merits due to the location of the domain.&#x20;

Any coterie can only take 1 merit per trait (one merit per Lien, one merit per Chasse, one merit per Portillon).&#x20;

Unless specified on the merit, they help forming the coterie traits.

**At coterie creation, the coterie can only take 1 trait merit.**&#x20;

To gain additional merits, a project will have to be done and if successfull, the coterie can buy the merit.&#x20;

Those merits need to make sense with the location of the domain and it's also limited by the other pre existing coterie.

If already one or two coterie have the `Police Station` merit, for example, a third coterie might be denied access to the merit, as there is a limited amount of Police Stations in Montreal.

Work with the named locations, the real world map and the ST team to find a suitable location and suitable merits.

The merits add to the rating.&#x20;

As we can see in the example, the Coterie has Portillon 1 and Transit that counts for 2.&#x20;

That makes the portillon rating of the coterie at a total of 3. The coterie can buy another dot of portillon and that would bring the coterie at 4 dots of portillon.

A coterie can have a rating of maximum 3 at coterie creation. Any increase has to be discussed with the st team, and any merit has to be purchased following a project and/or a scene/quest. Achieving 4 or 5 dots in any rating is considered pretty hard as they massively change the geopolitical landscape of the city.

A coterie can also swap the rating of the traits for the merits, when they acquire them.&#x20;

For example, if a Coterie has 3 dots of Lien, then following a quest they might acquire the merit "Campus ●●●".&#x20;

They can convert the 3 dots of Lien into the 3 dots of Campus and maintain a rating of 3 at no cost (other than the quest/project to acquire the merit).

### Location bonuses

Each location has some bonus that have to be discovered by the coterie that takes ownership, following a project. Those bonuses are hidden until a successfull project uncovers them. A coterie has access to the bonus of any location they have access to (this is why domains are linked to named locations and this is also why coterie hardly have the chance to hold multiple locations).

Those projects are designed to be long and the bonus are going to be worth your effort. Please discuss in your coterie ticket how to conduct this kind of project.

Known location bonuses:

* \*\* #Notre Dame De grace - Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church\*\*: The parish is trusted and respected in the neighborhood, and its clergy and volunteers turn a blind eye to small irregularities. Once per story, if the coterie spends 3 dot of Resources or succeeds on a DC 6 Charisma + Persuasion test, they may call on the parish network to cover up an “incident” (a disappearance, suspicious noise, or odd activity) in the area. This erases one night’s worth of Masquerade exposure in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, though repeated use may draw suspicion from outside the parish.
