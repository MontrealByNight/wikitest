# Welcome to Montreal by Night!

This is a VTM RPG server. We use the rules and the system of VTM v5, with some slight adjustments and houserules to better fit the Play-by-Post format and the chronicle.

The game will touch dark subjects, violence, content warnings and so on. There could be graphic description of any of those subjects.

And because of that, the server is strictly a 18+ server. If you are not 18 \[or whatever is the legal age in your own country] please leave the server immediately.

By clicking on the emoji you accept the aforementioned rules and you declare that you are 18+ and you will gain access to the server.

Also, obviously, we are in no way affiliated with White Wolf, Paradox or any copyrighted entity and we can operate under the Dark Pack license.
